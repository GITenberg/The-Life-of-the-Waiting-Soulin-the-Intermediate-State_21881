v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>These Addresses were delivered in Chichester Cathedral, and 
subsequently, with slight alterations, at Hastings.&nbsp; They 
would not have been printed but at the urgent request of very 
many who heard them preached.&nbsp; It should be remembered that 
they are not a theological treatise, but a course of plain words 
addressed to an ordinary congregation.&nbsp; It seemed desirable 
to awaken interest in a subject which has dropped out of English 
Christian thought, and almost out of people&rsquo;s 
knowledge.&nbsp; The Addresses are an attempt to explain what can
be known about the Intermediate Life.&nbsp; There is nothing new 
in them.&nbsp; If there were, probably what is new would not be 
true.</p>
<p>The doctrines of so-called &ldquo;Universalism&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Conditional Immortality&rdquo; are not touched upon.&nbsp;
They do not belong to the period <!-- page vi--><a 
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>which is 
covered by the Intermediate State.&nbsp; Moreover, I doubt 
whether we can ever regard those doctrines as anything more than 
speculations invented to answer modern and possibly ephemeral 
objections.</p>
<p>How much I have unconsciously been indebted to those who have 
dealt with this subject more fully, I hardly know.&nbsp; One 
reads and remembers, and reproduces in preaching, often without 
thought of the sources from which material has been drawn.&nbsp; 
I gratefully acknowledge in the notes what I know to be debts 
incurred.&nbsp; I can only express my regret if any have been 
overlooked.</p>

<p>There are moments in the lives of every one of us, when the 
mind is irresistibly drawn on to wonder what our own personal 
future shall be, as soon as life is over and death has overtaken 
us.&nbsp; We cannot help the speculation.&nbsp; However bound by 
present duties and absorbed in present interests, often, in quiet
hours, in times of solitude or bereavement, or under the sense of
failing hopes or failing health, in seasons of sorrow or of 
sickness, the mood takes hold of us; and it may be, we know not 
why, our eyes turn with an anxious and a wistful look towards 
that inevitable end which is surely coming upon us.</p>
<p>At such moments we ask ourselves, what <!-- page 2--><a 
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>will my lot be 
when the hand of death touches me&mdash;even <i>me</i>; when all 
the light of life goes out, all thought of this world&rsquo;s 
cares, all pleasant joys and hopes and desires of time sink down 
and fade into the chill gloom and shadow of the unknown?&nbsp; 
Such questionings, brought close home to our very selves, cannot 
but fill us with very anxious fears and misgivings, as we either 
look back upon the past, or think upon what chiefly possesses our
minds and thoughts now.&nbsp; Indeed, many of us cannot bear this
forward glance, and refuse to face it.&nbsp; We would fain brush 
the thought aside, and with some hasty utterance of vague trust, 
of shadowy self-comforting hope that <span 
class="smcap">God</span> will be merciful, we turn sharply round 
and give ourselves again to the calls of the life which is about 
us.</p>
<p>In this way, we Christians, we children of <span 
class="smcap">God</span>, heirs of life and immortality, learn to
be terrified at death, which, as we are taught to believe, ushers
us into life; learn to associate it with trembling doubt <!-- 
page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>and
shuddering dismay.&nbsp; But is this dread of death nothing else 
than the natural instinctive shrinking, which the warmth of life 
feels at the touch of its cold hand?&nbsp; Or is it not rather, 
in the case of most of us, due to some false imaginations with 
which religion itself&mdash;that form, at least, of religion 
which to-day encompasses us&mdash;has for many years possessed 
and imbued the minds of men?&nbsp; Indeed, I believe it to be 
so.&nbsp; The Christianity of to-day has too commonly accepted 
two untruths, which yet it holds as truths.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; One of them is this: That death ushers the soul 
immediately and finally into the supreme condition which awaits 
the souls of men; so that, at death, the souls of good men pass 
at once into heaven, while the souls of bad men pass at once into
hell; in other words, that the final and irrevocable severance 
between the just and the unjust takes place at death.&nbsp; 
Believing this, men have lost all faith in an Intermediate State 
between death and the Day <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>of Judgment.&nbsp; That intervening 
sojourn of the soul has virtually dropped out of recognition in 
the popular Christianity of the day, and is quite ignored.&nbsp; 
If you walk through any resting place of the bodies of the dead, 
into your own churchyards and cemeteries, you will, not seldom, 
find inscriptions upon tombs, which express the confident 
assurance that one, whose death is recorded, has already passed 
into heaven; that another has now become an angel of Light, or is
singing the praises of <span class="smcap">God</span> before the 
throne, is, in short, in the full present enjoyment of consummate
and final bliss.&nbsp; Thus it is that the Intermediate State 
between death and the final condition of happiness in heaven, 
which can only follow the Day of the Resurrection, is quite 
forgotten and overlooked.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; And the second untruth, which is closely connected 
with the first, is this: That there are but two classes of those 
who pass hence and are no more seen; <!-- page 5--><a 
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>classes sharply
distinguished, clearly outlined,&mdash;on the one hand, of those 
who at death go straight to heaven, and, on the other, of those 
who at death go straight to the place of final torment.&nbsp; If 
then these are the only two clearly marked and sharply defined 
alternatives, it follows that, whensoever we dare not be sure of 
any one soul at death that it was good enough certainly for 
heaven, there is nothing for it but to fear that the worse doom 
awaits it and that it is lost.&nbsp; For if it is not, at the 
moment of death, pure enough or good enough for heaven, into 
which there &ldquo;shall in no wise enter anything that defileth,
neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie,&rdquo; 
<a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5" 
class="citation">[5]</a> that soul, according to this false 
belief, is lost.&nbsp; Yet, in fact, what do we see within us and
around us, as we honestly look into our own lives, and upon the 
lives both of the best and of the worst among us?&nbsp; We see 
this, and we are convinced that we are <!-- page 6--><a 
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>not mistaken, 
that even among the most marked extremes of good men and evil 
men, few even of the best are so free from stain or fault as, at 
death, to be certainly fit for heaven, and few so vile and 
degraded as not to have still some good in them.&nbsp; And 
between these two extremes there are multitudes of mixed 
characters, in part good and in part bad.&nbsp; Among these, of 
whom we know that they are full of worth yet full of 
imperfections too, we count so many who are most dear to us, many
the companions of our lives, our kindred, and acquaintances, and 
cherished friends, whose failings and whose virtues we know so 
well, of mixed and imperfect character, too frail for heaven, too
good, too lovable for hell, partly good and partly not good, 
strong and also weak, marred with inconsistencies, and often for 
these very inconsistencies the more dear to us, of whom, so truly
have we loved and even honoured them, it seems almost like an 
outrage upon their memory to bring ourselves to think <!-- page 
7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>that 
there was just so much of evil in them and just so little good, 
as would suffice to turn the balance against them and thus fix, 
at the moment of their death, their final doom.</p>
<p>What are we to think of such as these?&nbsp; Of some we 
perhaps say within ourselves, &ldquo;Would that there had been 
but a little amendment of this blemish!&nbsp; A little more of 
strength and purpose against that fault!&nbsp; If only this 
besetting hardness had not been the spoiler of his life, that 
great heedlessness, that fatal procrastination, this too frequent
sin!&nbsp; Oh! but for this or that which marred the fair and 
well rounded character!&nbsp; But for this we should have been 
full of hope: there was so much on the better side, that we 
should have been full of trust, and even of confidence.&nbsp; 
But, now, what are we to think?&nbsp; If only there were some fit
and fair proportion to be thought of, duly measured out, of 
reward and punishment, a mixed destiny for a mixed character, 
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
8</span>partly good and partly evil for those who in this life 
were in part good and in part were evil!&nbsp; But these two 
awful and sharp alternatives, either reward or punishment, these 
two separate issues, heaven or hell, and if not heaven then 
necessarily and inevitably hell!&nbsp; What shall we think?&nbsp;
We dare not think.&nbsp; In the Bible we are encouraged to 
believe that we shall receive the due reward of our deeds, 
whether they be good or whether they be evil. <a 
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8" 
class="citation">[8]</a>&nbsp; But how shall any receive in 
heaven the due reward of evil deeds done on earth? and how, in 
hell, shall any wretched soul receive in any truth the due 
rewards of good deeds done on earth?&nbsp; Yet in each, there was
some good even in the worst, and some evil even in the 
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We see then what follows upon this false belief, that at death
an instant judgment assigns finally the destiny of all men, to 
men of every degree of wickedness, without distinction, Hell; and
one final <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>and absolute Heaven to men of every 
varying measure of goodness.&nbsp; Surely there is a great 
perplexity in this.&nbsp; No wonder if such beliefs lead men to 
dread the thought of death, of their own death, of the death of 
their friends.&nbsp; No mere physical repulsion makes us shrink, 
but rather the uncertainty and doubt of what may follow,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The dread of something 
after death,<br />
The undiscover&rsquo;d country, from whose bourn<br />
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and makes us Christian men and women turn to find relief from 
these bewildering fears by plunging deeply into the waters of 
life&rsquo;s amusements and ambitions.&nbsp; It is the 
uncertainty of things, wearing to some the aspect of caprice, 
which leads to recklessness, and sometimes to defiance.</p>
<p>I believe, from my heart, that Holy Scripture rightly 
understood solves these confusing riddles.&nbsp; I believe that a
more sound and Scriptural grasp of what will be the future of 
each of us after death, <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the restoration of a right belief in 
an Intermediate State, will go far to correct these unworthy and 
most un-Christian fears.&nbsp; But it is said, at times, that 
nothing can be really known about this Intermediate State, that 
all that can be asserted of it is mere guess and vain conjecture,
and even that it betrays a too curious intrusion into things 
unseen to speculate about the condition of souls after 
death.&nbsp; Yes! if we only speculate, but not surely if we seek
humbly to find out what the Bible has taught us.&nbsp; S. Paul 
did not think it a too presumptuous intrusion into things beyond 
the reach of our knowledge to make this enquiry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
would not have you to be ignorant concerning them which are 
asleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would rather that the Thessalonians 
should know all that can be known, to their edification.&nbsp; 
And something can be known, or he would not have written 
this.&nbsp; And to know it will be to our edification also.&nbsp;
Certainly to ignore what can be known has led, as we have seen, 
<!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
11</span>to loss and offence in these days.&nbsp; Therefore I 
propose to try and set before you not idle speculations indeed, 
but what has been actually revealed in Holy Scripture, or may be 
drawn from it about the Intermediate State.&nbsp; It is upon Holy
Scripture that we must depend for our learning.&nbsp; At least I 
shall make no attempt to build arguments upon any other 
foundation than Holy Scripture.&nbsp; But let us, in <span 
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Name, get out of Holy Scripture 
all that can, according to the proportion of the faith, be 
deduced from it.&nbsp; It is as perilous, not to say as undutiful
towards <span class="smcap">God</span>, the Revealer, to neglect 
what He has for our sakes revealed, as it would be to invent 
speculations of our own about that which He has not revealed.</p>
<p>The unseen world is not easy to apprehend, and to our 
matter-of-fact English mind and temper is especially 
difficult.&nbsp; Yet, with the awful future in our mind, which 
awaits not only those who are very dear to ourselves, but 
ourselves also, we <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>must be dull indeed, if we have no 
concern for it.&nbsp; Then if sober questioning may reveal more 
clearly to us what Holy Scripture can tell us of things that 
shall befall each of us, we may hope to gain fresh confidence, 
and to renew our trust in Him Who launched us into time, that we 
may live with Him in eternity through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>If we should ask what happens to the soul of a good man when 
he dies, the answer would probably be that he has gone to 
heaven.&nbsp; Of a little child it would be said at his death, 
that he has become an angel in heaven.&nbsp; But this would be 
quite untrue, because it contradicts the Bible.&nbsp; The Bible 
teaches that there will at the end of the world be a day when all
the dead shall rise and stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ,
to be judged for the deeds done in the body, whether they be 
good, or whether they be evil.&nbsp; But if a good man&rsquo;s 
soul goes straight to heaven at death, without waiting for the 
Day of Judgment, he practically has no Day of Judgment at 
all.&nbsp; He escapes it.&nbsp; The <!-- page 14--><a 
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Bible also 
teaches that before the Day of Judgment there will be a general 
Resurrection of all, both of the just and of the unjust. <a 
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14" 
class="citation">[14]</a>&nbsp; But how can one who is already in
heaven, while his body lies in the grave of corruption,&mdash;how
can he, being already glorified and even now beholding the vision
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, to any intelligible purpose, 
or for any conceivable end, take part in the general 
Resurrection?&nbsp; Why should he, as it were, come away from 
heaven and rise from the dead, in order to be judged?</p>
<p>Thus the popular belief, that the souls of the righteous pass 
straight to heaven, and the souls of the wicked go straight to 
hell, is against the plain teaching of the Bible.&nbsp; But the 
Bible not only contradicts this popular and careless fancy.&nbsp;
It asserts what is directly contrary to it: it asserts 
positively, I mean, that there is an age-long period between 
death and the final state of happiness or misery, during which 
period the soul is separate from the body <!-- page 15--><a 
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>and remains 
separate.&nbsp; We are, according to the Bible, destined to 
undergo three great changes in the mode and nature of our 
existence.&nbsp; In the first period, while we are here in this 
our life on earth, the soul and spirit are united to a material 
and tangible body of flesh and blood, suited to our life 
here.&nbsp; The second stage begins at death, the name we give to
the separation which then takes place between this material 
fabric of the body and the incorporeal part of us; and then the 
soul and spirit dwell disembodied for a time.&nbsp; There follows
at the Resurrection the third period, when the soul and spirit 
are reunited with the body, but with the body now so 
spiritualized and refined as to suit the heavenly 
existence.&nbsp; The second of these two periods, coming between 
the first and the third, is therefore fitly called the 
intermediate or middle state, the state in which the disembodied 
soul dwells apart from its material tenement. <a 
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15" 
class="citation">[15]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>What has the Bible then to say about this Intermediate 
State?&nbsp; I will not ask you to listen to the comments or 
interpretations of the early Christian writers, although, of 
course, very great respect is due to what they say.&nbsp; I will 
only beg of you to pay common attention to what the Bible itself 
says.</p>
<p>Now, first, I will point to the words which our Lord spoke 
from the Cross, just before His Death, to the thief who was also 
slowly dying at His side.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; He said, 
&ldquo;shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.&rdquo;&nbsp; So then 
within a few hours,&mdash;it was then not yet mid-day&mdash;they 
were both to be in Paradise.&nbsp; They both died before sunset, 
and at their death both entered Paradise.&nbsp; Their dead bodies
were left behind upon the Cross.&nbsp; What then entered 
Paradise?&nbsp; Not their bodies, but the spiritual or 
incorporeal part of them.&nbsp; Was Paradise then another name 
for heaven?&nbsp; It cannot be; our Lord did not go to heaven 
until the day of His Ascension, <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>forty-three 
days after His death.&nbsp; For, after His Resurrection, He said 
to S. Mary Magdalene, &ldquo;I am <i>not yet</i> ascended to My 
Father.&rdquo; <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17" 
class="citation">[17]</a>&nbsp; With His risen body, united again
to His human soul and spirit, He went to Heaven, His whole human 
nature now being, by His Resurrection, again completely 
one.&nbsp; But into Paradise only part of His human nature 
passed, the spiritual part of it, along with the spiritual part 
of the thief&rsquo;s human nature.&nbsp; Our Lord&rsquo;s soul 
and spirit came back, as we know, from Paradise on the third 
day.&nbsp; The soul and spirit of the thief remain there 
still.&nbsp; So then this is what our Lord Himself teaches us as 
to the state of the disembodied spirit, that at death a just 
man&rsquo;s spirit does <i>not</i> go to heaven, but into a 
sphere of life which is called Paradise.</p>
<p>But, if this be so, why, it may be asked, did not our Lord 
speak in plainer and more definite language?&nbsp; Such a truth, 
it may be urged, a truth which so much <!-- page 18--><a 
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>concerns us, 
ought not to depend upon a single text.&nbsp; I do not propose to
ask you to be content with an inference from a single text.&nbsp;
But it may be that our Lord did not say more than this about the 
great truth with which we are dealing for this reason, that the 
disciples whom He gathered round Him, being Jews, perfectly well 
knew what He meant by Paradise.&nbsp; This single reference, 
therefore, is enough to show that what was a common and prevalent
belief among the Jews was a true belief,&mdash;a belief which our
Lord not only recognized, but by recognizing established and 
sanctioned.&nbsp; But if we are once clear on this point, we 
shall find the belief more plainly set forth by our Lord in 
another place.&nbsp; What then is the belief that we have learned
from this single passage?&nbsp; We have learned this, that the 
human spirit of our Lord, and the spirit of the dying thief did 
not pass at death to heaven, though if any spirit should ever be 
fit to pass at death to heaven His spirit was fit, but to a state
which He called Paradise.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>Now, there was another expression used in the ordinary 
Jewish language of the day for the state to which the blessed 
dead passed at death.&nbsp; They were spoken of as at rest 
&ldquo;in Abraham&rsquo;s bosom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of a very holy man 
they would say, &ldquo;This day he rests in Abraham&rsquo;s 
bosom.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that in the minds of the Jews and 
therefore of the disciples the term &ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; meant 
exactly the same thing as &ldquo;Abraham&rsquo;s 
bosom.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have learned what &ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; 
meant.&nbsp; Therefore now we know what &ldquo;resting in 
Abraham&rsquo;s bosom&rdquo; meant.&nbsp; It meant the 
Intermediate State. <a name="citation19"></a><a 
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; The scene then
in the narrative of the <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>rich man and Lazarus, which follows 
the deaths of the two men, belongs not to the final state of 
happiness and misery at all, but to the Intermediate State.&nbsp;
The joy is the joy of the Intermediate State.&nbsp; The 
suffering, which is in such strong contrast to the joy as to be 
divided from it by a deep gulf, so that the joy cannot be tinged 
with the misery, nor the misery relieved by the joy,&mdash;this 
suffering also is the suffering of the Intermediate State.</p>
<p>The reality then of the Intermediate State is confirmed by our
Lord in this narrative.&nbsp; Now observe the weight of this 
testimony.&nbsp; If the Jews were wrong in believing that the 
spirits of the just passed into Paradise or into Abraham&rsquo;s 
bosom our Lord would never have uttered words twice over which 
sanctioned their mistake.&nbsp; We may observe further from these
two passages that the Intermediate State has two parts or 
conditions.&nbsp; There are those in it who suffer, and there are
those who rejoice.&nbsp; At death, the spirits of those <!-- page
21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>whose
lives have been evil pass to suffering and anguish, as we read of
the rich man that &ldquo;in Hades he lifted up his eyes being in 
torments&rdquo;; and the spirits of the faithful pass to rest and
joy.&nbsp; But between these two representatives in the 
narrative, the one of the evil, the other of the good, there are 
the multitudes who are neither very good nor very evil, so varied
in the indeterminate tokens of good and evil which marked their 
lives on earth, that it would seem to be impossible for us to 
know on which side of &ldquo;the great gulf&rdquo; their position
ought to be.&nbsp; But if the extremes enter the Intermediate 
State, and there is room for them in it, is it to be supposed 
that there is no room for those who are between the 
extremes?&nbsp; Rather do we learn that the spirits of all go 
thither, not only of the faithful and of the wicked, but of the 
wavering and uncertain also, of those who were weak and fell, of 
those who, with unsteady and tottering steps, sometimes rising, 
often <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>falling, now obeying, now rebelling, 
now believing, now doubting, now walking in the light, now 
plunged in darkness, at one time treading firmly the ground of 
the narrow path, and then at times wandering into the quagmires 
and morasses of sin and lust, passed through the pilgrimage of 
life, and, at length, when their allotted span was completed, 
were assigned to the place which awaited them, to the place which
was their own and was fitted for them.</p>
<p>We have seen what conclusions must be drawn from the express 
language of our Lord Himself.&nbsp; Let us now examine the 
evidence afforded by His Apostles, in the Epistles and in the 
book of the Revelation.&nbsp; But first I would ask you to 
consider what, according to the Bible, is the chief feature in 
the conception of the happiness and glory of Heaven, what is its 
essential nature.&nbsp; Is it not this, that being the dwelling 
place of <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself, the glory and 
happiness of Heaven will consist in the Presence itself of <span 
class="smcap">God</span>, and therefore <!-- page 23--><a 
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>in the vision
of <span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; As a great writer has 
said, &ldquo;It must be remarked by everybody that the glory of 
the future state is always put before us not as an inner 
consciousness or mental communion simply, not as an absorption 
into ourselves within, but as a great spectacle without us, the 
spectacle of a great visible manifestation of <span 
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; It is a sight, a picture, a 
representation, that constitutes the heavenly state, not mere 
thought and contemplation.&nbsp; The glorified saint of Scripture
is especially a beholder; he gazes, he looks, he fixes his eyes 
upon something before him; he does not merely ruminate within, 
but his whole mind is carried out towards and upon a great 
representation.&nbsp; And thus Heaven specially appears in 
Scripture as the sphere of perfected sight, where the faculty is 
raised and exalted to its highest act, and the happiness of 
existence culminates in vision.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23" 
class="citation">[23]</a>&nbsp; If this be so, all the most 
entrancing spectacles <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>and scenes of earth shall appear dim 
and coarse and uncouth in comparison with the sight on which the 
ravished gaze of eternity shall be fastened.&nbsp; For then shall
our eyes see &ldquo;The King in His Beauty.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a" 
class="citation">[24a]</a>&nbsp; They shall see <span 
class="smcap">God</span>, see Him face to face,&mdash;<span 
class="smcap">God</span>!&nbsp; No higher conception of happiness
is set before the heart of man, which ever craves for heaven and 
for perfection, than <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself, the 
sight of <span class="smcap">God</span>, the Presence of <span 
class="smcap">God</span>, the Knowledge of <span 
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;In Thy Presence is the 
fulness of joy.&rdquo; <a name="citation24b"></a><a 
href="#footnote24b" class="citation">[24b]</a>&nbsp; But we must 
not lose sight of the effect which this vision of <span 
class="smcap">God</span> produces upon those who gaze.&nbsp; To 
see Him is to become like Him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; says S. 
John, &ldquo;we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He 
is.&rdquo; <a name="citation24c"></a><a href="#footnote24c" 
class="citation">[24c]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;We all,&rdquo; says S. 
Paul, &ldquo;with open face, beholding, as in a glass, the glory 
of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to 
glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is what seeing <span 
class="smcap">God</span> will do.</p>
<p>When, then, shall this vision be granted?&nbsp; <!-- page 
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>At 
death to any?&nbsp; No! but only at the Second Coming of 
Christ.&nbsp; All the great writers of the Epistles speak, as 
with one voice, of this.&nbsp; What says S. Peter?&nbsp; 
&ldquo;When the chief Shepherd <i>shall appear</i>, ye shall 
receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a" 
class="citation">[25a]</a>&nbsp; Not therefore at death, but at 
Christ&rsquo;s Second Coming and appearance.&nbsp; What does S. 
John say?&nbsp; &ldquo;We know that <i>when He shall appear</i>, 
we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b" 
class="citation">[25b]</a>&nbsp; Not therefore until that 
time.&nbsp; What again does the great S. Paul say?&nbsp; 
&ldquo;When Christ, Who is our life, <i>shall appear</i>, then 
shall ye also appear with Him in glory.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation25c"></a><a href="#footnote25c" 
class="citation">[25c]</a>&nbsp; Again to S. Timothy he writes, 
&ldquo;There is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which 
the Lord <i>the righteous Judge</i>, shall give to me <i>at that 
day</i>: and not only to me, but also to all them that have loved
<i>His appearing</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation25d"></a><a 
href="#footnote25d" class="citation">[25d]</a>&nbsp; There can be
no doubt what S. Paul means by &ldquo;That Day.&rdquo;&nbsp; It 
is the day when &ldquo;the Righteous Judge&rdquo; <!-- page 
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>on 
His Judgment throne shall award the crowns to those who have 
fought the good fight and kept the faith.&nbsp; This is the 
frequent meaning of the expressions, &ldquo;That day,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;The day of the Lord,&rdquo; in the New Testament.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;We know it,&rdquo; says Dr. Liddon, &ldquo;by a more 
familiar name given it on three occasions by our Lord Himself, 
and on three at least by His Apostles after Him: it is the Day of
Judgment.&rdquo; <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26" 
class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; S. Paul, therefore, when he says,
&ldquo;There is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which 
the Lord will give me on that day,&rdquo; does not expect that 
crown until the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>These are a few out of many like passages, all showing that 
heaven is not reached at death, but only after the Day of 
Judgment.&nbsp; From all which it is clear that the Apostles had 
in their minds the firm assurance that there was to be a waiting 
time, how long they knew not, or how short they knew not, during 
which the spirit without the <!-- page 27--><a 
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>body would 
dwell in expectation.&nbsp; If it were otherwise, if at death the
spirit passes into the light which no man can approach unto, into
the Presence of <span class="smcap">God</span> and beholds the 
Beatific Vision, which, as we saw, constitutes the consummation 
of happiness and perfection in heaven, I would ask, how it can be
conceived that our Lord would have called Lazarus back from that 
supreme happiness, which eye hath never seen nor ear ever heard, 
nor heart of man ever conceived,&mdash;called him back to mingle 
in the griefs and sorrows, the pains and failures, the doubts and
fears, the mists and confusions of this earthly life.&nbsp; Was 
this the act of Him Who loved Lazarus?&nbsp; Was there no other 
way of consoling the living sisters, than by so great a loss to 
the vanished brother?&nbsp; Was it not to call him from life to 
death, rather than from death to life?</p>
<p>One more passage must be quoted, the force of which cannot 
well be missed.&nbsp; In the sixth chapter of the Book of the 
Revelation, <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>S. John describes the vision which he
saw at the opening of the fifth seal.&nbsp; He saw, he said, 
&ldquo;under the altar the souls of them that had been slain for 
the word of <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;and they cried 
with a great voice, saying, How long, O Master, the holy and 
true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell
on the earth?&mdash;And it was said unto them, that they should 
rest yet for a little while, until their fellow-servants also and
their brethren . . . should be fulfilled.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28" 
class="citation">[28]</a>&nbsp; Plainly these souls were not in 
heaven, for they bemoaned the long delay, and were bidden to wait
for awhile until some great fulfilment.&nbsp; Where then could 
they be, if not on earth, nor yet in heaven?&nbsp; They must have
been in the Middle State between the two, these martyred souls, 
in Paradise.&nbsp; But they are not spoken of as in Paradise, or 
in Abraham&rsquo;s bosom, but as &ldquo;under the 
Altar.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where was this?&nbsp; The Jews spoke of 
departed souls <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>not only as in Paradise, and in 
Abraham&rsquo;s bosom, but also as &ldquo;under the throne of 
Glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; By all these expressions they meant the same 
thing.&nbsp; S. John, however, uses a different expression in 
describing the Intermediate State, yet one so similar as to lead 
us to think that in the change he substitutes a Christian formula
for the Jewish, giving it a Christian shape.&nbsp; As &ldquo;the 
throne of Glory&rdquo; was associated with the Presence of <span 
class="smcap">God</span> in the mind of a devout Jew, so the 
Altar would be as naturally associated with the Presence of <span
class="smcap">God</span> in the mind of a devout Christian.&nbsp;
What, therefore, the &ldquo;Throne of <span 
class="smcap">God</span>&rdquo; was to the Jew, that &ldquo;the 
Altar of <span class="smcap">God</span>&rdquo; would be to a 
Christian.&nbsp; For the Altar was to Christian thought the 
Throne of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; There, at the 
Christian Altar was commemorated the one great sacrifice to which
all former sacrifices had pointed, and in which they were all 
fulfilled.&nbsp; There the communion of Saints was, as in no 
other way on earth, realized.&nbsp; There, <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>as by one 
simultaneous vibration thrilling through the saintly dead, and 
the living communicants, the spiritual bond unites together in 
one unbroken living Communion, those of the Church expectant who 
are departed in the true faith of Christ&rsquo;s Holy Name, and 
those of us who are still striving in the Church militant on 
earth to perfect our probation.&nbsp; These souls &ldquo;under 
the Altar&rdquo; were still waiting, and their waiting wearied 
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;How long?&rdquo; they cried.&nbsp; They were 
not in the flesh, their bodies had been slain.&nbsp; They were 
absent from the body and present with the Lord, with Christ, as 
the crucified thief is still with Christ, in Paradise.</p>
<p>The consummation for them is yet to come.&nbsp; They are 
waiting for it.&nbsp; It is postponed.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> work on earth is yet 
uncompleted.&nbsp; The number of the elect is not yet made 
up.&nbsp; The Second Coming of Christ is yet delayed.&nbsp; All 
things are not yet ready.&nbsp; A little while longer must they 
wait, that they without us may not be made perfect.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So far we have examined the witness which the Bible affords in
support of the truth that there is such a sphere as the 
Intermediate State, in which the spirit dwells alone, apart from 
the body, awaiting the Day of Judgment.&nbsp; We have now to see 
what can be known as to the condition of the spirit in that 
disembodied state.&nbsp; It is one thing to be assured on good 
grounds that there is such a life, and quite another thing to be 
assured what sort of life it is.&nbsp; Can we fully understand 
what is meant by the life of the spiritual part of our being when
it is separated from the body?&nbsp; We cannot.&nbsp; We cannot 
understand that of which we have had no experience.&nbsp; In 
speaking, therefore, of the <!-- page 32--><a 
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>disembodied 
spirit, we are speaking of that which we cannot explain.&nbsp; 
Yet it does not in consequence follow that it is impossible to 
believe it to be.&nbsp; For we are bound in reason to be assured 
of many things of which we can form no conception.&nbsp; Reason 
compels us to be assured of the reality of space, of eternity, of
the creation of the universe out of nothing, and, perhaps we may 
add, of the being of <span class="smcap">God</span>; the being of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, I mean, considered apart from His
nature and attributes.&nbsp; Yet we cannot form any intelligent 
conception of these realities.&nbsp; We cannot shape to our 
apprehension the faintest rational conception of the Personality 
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, of His Omniscience, of His 
Omnipresence.&nbsp; Yet we are able, and indeed are forced to 
believe, as Christians, in these attributes of His Nature, 
although we cannot comprehend them.</p>
<p>In the same sense, we can be reasonably sure that the spirit 
can still live after it has left the body, even though we are 
<!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
33</span>unable to form to our minds any clear conception of the 
existence of the disembodied spirit.&nbsp; We can do more.&nbsp; 
On the assumption of the existence of the disembodied spirit, we 
are able, to some extent also, to reason upon the laws and limits
of that separate and secluded life.</p>
<p>We are, no doubt, in so doing, dealing with a profoundly 
mysterious subject.&nbsp; But it does not therefore follow that 
we are thereby really intruding into things which ought not to be
enquired into.&nbsp; For the questions raised in the search 
concern us very closely; and, moreover, it is a matter about 
which <span class="smcap">God</span> has made a revelation.&nbsp;
And to know more about it than many people even care to know is a
safeguard against many an unwholesome fear, against many a 
mischievous deceit.</p>
<p>On the very threshold of this enquiry we are confronted with 
this question: &ldquo;Is the soul the same thing as the 
spirit?&nbsp; If not, what is the soul, and what is the 
spirit?&rdquo;&nbsp; That the Bible regards them <!-- page 
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>as 
distinct is sufficiently clear from the language used by S. Paul 
in his first Epistle to the Thessalonians: &ldquo;I pray <span 
class="smcap">God</span> your whole spirit, soul, and body be 
preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus 
Christ.&rdquo; <a name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a" 
class="citation">[34a]</a>&nbsp; The same distinction is marked 
in the Epistle to the Hebrews: &ldquo;The word of <span 
class="smcap">God</span> is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of 
soul and spirit.&rdquo; <a name="citation34b"></a><a 
href="#footnote34b" class="citation">[34b]</a>&nbsp; It is thus 
that we understand the contrast which S. Paul enforces between 
things of the spirit and things of the soul.&nbsp; &ldquo;The 
<i>natural</i> man,&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the psychical man, 
the man who yields to the sway of the 
soul,&mdash;&ldquo;receiveth not the things of the spirit of 
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation34c"></a><a href="#footnote34c" 
class="citation">[34c]</a>&nbsp; And again, speaking of the 
resurrection, he writes: &ldquo;It is sown a natural 
body,&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, literally a psychical body, a 
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
35</span>body which is subject to the sway of the 
soul,&mdash;&ldquo;it is raised a spiritual 
body,&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a body subject to the sway of the
spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a natural body, and there is a 
spiritual body.&rdquo; <a name="citation35a"></a><a 
href="#footnote35a" class="citation">[35a]</a>&nbsp; When again 
S. James says: &ldquo;This wisdom . . . is earthly, 
<i>sensual</i>, devilish,&rdquo;&mdash;the word translated 
&ldquo;sensual&rdquo; is the same word &ldquo;psychical,&rdquo; 
<i>i.e.</i>, subject to the sway of the soul. <a 
name="citation35b"></a><a href="#footnote35b" 
class="citation">[35b]</a>&nbsp; S. Jude speaks of those who are 
&ldquo;sensual,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, psychical, &ldquo;not having 
the spirit.&rdquo; <a name="citation35c"></a><a 
href="#footnote35c" class="citation">[35c]</a>&nbsp; Enough has 
been said to show that, according to the Bible, the soul is the 
seat of the senses, the desires, the will, the reasoning and 
intellectual faculties, the thoughts of the mind.&nbsp; What then
is the spirit in man?&nbsp; We seem to have the answer given to 
us in the account of man&rsquo;s creation, when we are told that 
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> formed man of the dust of 
the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, 
and man became a living soul.&rdquo; <a name="citation35d"></a><a
href="#footnote35d" class="citation">[35d]</a>&nbsp; This breath 
of <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
36</span><span class="smcap">God</span> could be nothing less 
than the spirit, which came from <span class="smcap">God</span> 
Himself.&nbsp; It is that higher endowment by which man is a 
spiritual being, and therefore has an affinity to <span 
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; It is that which makes him <span 
class="smcap">God</span>-like, even by nature, at least by his 
nature as it was before the fall.&nbsp; But even the fall did not
utterly dissolve that nature; man still remained a spiritual 
being, although the spiritual part of him was subject to the sway
of the animal in him, and to the senses of the lower 
nature.&nbsp; Until that creative act of <span 
class="smcap">God</span>, man&rsquo;s body and soul were scarcely
higher in the order and rank of being than the body and soul of 
the brute.&nbsp; It was the gift of the divine spirit which 
caused man&rsquo;s soul truly to live, so that he became then 
&ldquo;a <i>living</i> soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; Herein, henceforth, the
soul of man differs from the soul of the lower creature.&nbsp; In
man the soul is in contact with the spirit.&nbsp; The beast 
shares with man the possession of an animal soul.&nbsp; It is the
prerogative of man to be endowed <!-- page 37--><a 
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>also with 
spirit.&nbsp; By the spirit, man is capable of apprehending <span
class="smcap">God</span>, can commune with <span 
class="smcap">God</span>, can long for Him.&nbsp; Herein lies his
capacity for religion.&nbsp; His soul is incorporeal no less than
his spirit.&nbsp; It is, as it were, midway between the body and 
the spirit.&nbsp; It touches the body on the one side, on the 
other side it touches the spirit.&nbsp; The desires and the 
thoughts of the soul may become enslaved by the body, or they may
become the servants of the spirit.&nbsp; The soul is the prize, 
for the mastery of which the spirit strives, and the flesh or 
body strives.&nbsp; The spirit may gain the soul, or the flesh 
may gain the soul.&nbsp; If the spirit loses the soul, it is a 
loss fatal and irreparable.&nbsp; The soul is drawn now this way 
by the baser longings of the flesh, now that way by the nobler 
appeals of the spirit.&nbsp; It is the &ldquo;debateable 
ground&rdquo; <a name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37" 
class="citation">[37]</a> on which the real battle of life is 
fought.&nbsp; &ldquo;The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and 
the spirit against <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gaining 
of the soul is the gaining of the whole man.&nbsp; The losing of 
the soul is the losing of the whole man.&nbsp; Those have 
degraded and brutalized their life whose human spirit has yielded
up its supremacy, whose soul has been swept along in captivity by
the bodily desires.&nbsp; For as in some the spirit shapes the 
whole soul, so in others the soul, enslaved by the flesh, shapes 
the spirit.</p>
<p>Death at length steps in, and tears asunder the flesh from the
incorporeal part of us; and soul and spirit, still united, pass 
together to the life which awaits them in the world unseen.</p>
<h2><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And when he had said this he fell 
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<span 
class="smcap">Acts</span> <span class="smcap">vii.</span> 60.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At death, as we have seen, the spirit and the soul are 
separated from the body, and, still united together, are launched
into the unseen world.&nbsp; For though the soul is not the 
spirit, these two form the incorporeal parts of our compound 
nature, are the two immaterial elements of that trinity of 
life,&mdash;body, soul, spirit, which are united to make one 
human being.&nbsp; They both survive death.&nbsp; For death is 
the separation of the soul from the body, not of the soul from 
the spirit.&nbsp; But it must be remembered that the spirit, when
at death it is, in company with the soul, withdrawn from the 
body, passes into the Intermediate State, shaped and stamped with
the impress which the life on earth has fastened upon it.&nbsp; 
The <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
40</span>spirit enters the new life, either enslaved, disfigured,
degraded, dishonoured by the sensual soul, or else strong, free, 
true, purified in its victory over the flesh.&nbsp; It carries 
with it, in short, the character which in life it has 
acquired.</p>
<p>It may be well to fall into the usage of ordinary speech, and 
speak of that which survives death as the <i>soul</i>, so long as
we keep in mind what is really meant, viz., that it is the soul 
<i>united with the spirit</i> which survives death.</p>
<p>When, then, we say that the disembodied soul enters the 
Intermediate Life, we are bound to consider in what condition it 
enters it.&nbsp; For people sometimes argue thus: &ldquo;Yes! I 
grant that there will be an interval or waiting time between 
death and the Day of Judgment.&nbsp; But then, during that time, 
is not the soul asleep?&nbsp; Surely the dying are said to fall 
asleep.&nbsp; Then, if asleep, they are unconscious, and to the 
unconscious soul the Intermediate State will seem to last but for
an instant, <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>and will no sooner be entered upon 
than it will be practically at an end.&nbsp; For complete 
insensibility to the passing and movement of time is one of the 
effects of complete unconsciousness.&nbsp; And, in truth, is it 
not the case that the Bible over and over again speaks of death 
as a state of sleep or taking rest? <a name="citation41a"></a><a 
href="#footnote41a" class="citation">[41a]</a>&nbsp; Thus the 
Intermediate State is in fact a blank.&nbsp; The eyes close in 
death, and they remain closed till they open to gaze upon the 
glories of the Resurrection, and the terrors of the judgment seat
of Christ.&nbsp; Does not our own Prayer Book sanction this view 
in her Service for the Burial of the Dead? <a 
name="citation41b"></a><a href="#footnote41b" 
class="citation">[41b]</a>&nbsp; And do we not in common language
ourselves express the same belief when we give to the resting 
place of the bodies of the dead the name of 
&lsquo;cemetery,&rsquo; or sleeping place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer to all this is that the language which represents 
death as a <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>profound slumber is language 
applicable enough to describe what befalls the body, but is quite
inapplicable when it is used of the soul.&nbsp; Sleep is 
distinctly a physical and corporeal function.&nbsp; The soul 
cannot be liable to or affected by corporeal influences when it 
is separated from the body.&nbsp; The soul cannot sleep.&nbsp; It
is the body, in the hushed stillness of the chamber of death, 
which seems, now that the last struggle is over, and the spasm of
dying leaves it motionless, to be sleeping.&nbsp; But even in 
life, while the body sleeps, the soul is awake.&nbsp; It is 
often, during the sleep of the body, even more active than during
the waking hours.&nbsp; In dreams the soul is busy with its 
fancies.&nbsp; Thoughts flit this way and that through the mind 
of the sleeper.&nbsp; Indeed, the body is more often a hindrance 
rather than a help to the activities of thought.&nbsp; To lose 
all consciousness of the existence of the body, to be as if the 
body for the time were not,&mdash;this is to set the mind <!-- 
page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
43</span>thinking in freedom unrestrained.&nbsp; For the body and
the conscious sensation of the presence of the body seem to serve
to drag down and encumber the energy of thought.&nbsp; A sound 
through the ear, a sight presented to the eye, a touch, an 
ache,&mdash;these break off sustained thinking.&nbsp; No wonder, 
when the body sleeps profoundly, the soul is often then most 
active.&nbsp; And will not this be so when the profoundest sleep 
of all falls upon the body?</p>
<p>It is clear that the disembodied soul, if we may again go back
to the Bible, is not by our Lord regarded as in a state of 
lethargy and dull unconsciousness.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; 
said He, &ldquo;shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
If this promise was meant to be a blessing and a solace it was 
meant to be consciously <i>felt</i> as a blessing and a 
solace.&nbsp; How else could the thief have been in any true 
sense with Christ?&nbsp; S. Paul said, &ldquo;For me to live is 
Christ, to die is gain.&rdquo; <a name="citation43"></a><a 
href="#footnote43" class="citation">[43]</a>&nbsp; Gain!&nbsp; 
Wherein could <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>it be a gain to him to die, if to die
was to exchange that eager, active vitality, so full of welcome 
pain and happy suffering, so full of a service, whose fruits were
rich in blessing,&mdash;to exchange all this for dull heaviness 
and blank oblivion?</p>
<p>In the narrative of the rich man and Lazarus, which, as we 
saw, describes the Intermediate State, the rich man is said to 
have &ldquo;lifted up his eyes being in torments.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
So, then, his pain was felt.&nbsp; He was conscious; he 
reflected; he remembered; he spoke.&nbsp; Once more, in a 
remarkable passage in the First Epistle of S. Peter, to which, on
a future occasion, I shall again refer, our Lord is spoken of as 
&ldquo;having been put to death in the flesh, but 
quickened,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, made alive, &ldquo;in 
spirit&rdquo; <a name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44" 
class="citation">[44]</a>; words which, whatever the context may 
mean, can only have the force of bringing the effect of death in 
its relation to Christ&rsquo;s human body into sharp contrast 
with its effect in relation <!-- page 45--><a 
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>to His human 
spirit.&nbsp; In respect of His human body He was put to death; 
but in respect of His human spirit He was quickened or lived, 
lived still, in Paradise, though His body was dead.&nbsp; I need 
not, I think, refer to other passages.&nbsp; It is abundantly 
clear, both from the necessity of the thing, and from the obvious
testimony of the Bible, that the soul still lives, still is 
awake, still is conscious.</p>
<p>What, then, follows from the soul&rsquo;s consciousness in and
through the passage of death?&nbsp; Obviously this,&mdash;that 
the life of the soul goes on, and is therefore the life of the 
same soul, sustained without break or interruption, after death, 
by an unsuspended continuity of the consciousness of personal 
identity.&nbsp; For of what is the soul still conscious?&nbsp; Of
itself.&nbsp; The life therefore of the soul after death is one 
with the life of the soul before death.&nbsp; The same soul lives
on.&nbsp; The only change to it is the absence of the body, which
has been withdrawn from it, and is laid in the <!-- page 46--><a 
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>ground, and 
dissolves into dust.&nbsp; And this continuous consciousness of 
identity means that the soul&rsquo;s character is preserved 
unchanged and unaffected by the shock of the separation.&nbsp; 
For a character it had been contracting during its sojourn in the
body, a character of its own.&nbsp; The spiritualized soul before
death is a spiritualized soul after death.&nbsp; The animalized 
soul before death remains after death an animalized soul.&nbsp; 
The righteous is righteous still.&nbsp; The holy, the pure, the 
faithful, the devout, the true, are true, and devout, and 
faithful, and pure, and holy still.&nbsp; The wicked and tainted 
soul is still wicked and tainted when it enters the unseen, and 
begins its life in the Intermediate State.&nbsp; It is on the 
other side what it was on this side.&nbsp; Death,&mdash;the 
crisis and shock of death,&mdash;makes no change, no other change
than this, that it strips off the outer clothing which enveloped 
the soul.&nbsp; It leaves the soul the same, no better, no <!-- 
page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
47</span>worse.&nbsp; This is what is implied in the personal 
identity of the soul.&nbsp; It means the continuity of 
consciousness, and therefore continuity of character.</p>
<p>Do we cling to some vague and fanciful expectation that the 
mere act of dying, so to call it, will itself work a great change
upon the soul, will blot out our sins, will clear away our 
imperfections, will in an instant heal the wounds and scars, 
which evil habits, long inured in us, have wrought upon the 
soul?&nbsp; It will do nothing of the sort.&nbsp; We shall be no 
better, no holier on the other side than we were on this, no more
fitted for heaven than when we died.&nbsp; If this be 
so,&mdash;and, so far as we can see, it must be so,&mdash;how 
much does it behove us to fear greatly the peril we incur by a 
careless and <span class="smcap">God</span>-forgetting 
life!&nbsp; &ldquo;Israel doth not know,&rdquo; said the prophet,
&ldquo;My people doth not consider.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47" 
class="citation">[47]</a>&nbsp; That was the pity of it.&nbsp; It
was the thoughtlessness, <!-- page 48--><a 
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>and the 
ignorance which came of it, that ruined the nation.</p>
<p>Oh! that in life we would look things in the face more 
steadily!&nbsp; Would that we were ready to take heed how surely 
we are, day by day, shaping and moulding our character for good 
or for evil, a character which no shock of dissolution will 
affect, which will be ours when the crisis comes to end our 
probation here, and to usher us, as we are and have become, into 
that unseen life beyond!</p>

<p>The Intermediate Life is not a state of sleep, but a waiting 
time.&nbsp; But is it a time of mere waiting, and of unemployed 
quiescence?&nbsp; This would be no better than sleep.&nbsp; There
must be a reason for the waiting.&nbsp; And what other reason can
there be than that, during it, there is something to be done 
which can only be done then?&nbsp; S. Paul speaks, in the text, 
of work which he is confident will be carried on till it is 
brought to completion on the Day of Judgment.&nbsp; What is this 
work?&nbsp; We have seen that the Scriptural conception of the 
happiness of heaven is that it consists in the sight of <span 
class="smcap">God</span>, the Beatific Vision.&nbsp; But there 
can <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
50</span>enter the heavenly city nothing that defileth, nothing 
imperfect.&nbsp; It is the pure in heart who shall see <span 
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Isaiah dare hardly approach the 
vision of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> glory on earth, 
because he felt himself to be a man of unclean lips.&nbsp; The 
very heavens, the stars themselves, are not clean in <span 
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> sight.&nbsp; And at death, who 
is pure?&nbsp; Who is free from stain?&nbsp; Who is perfect, that
he should be fit to look upon <span 
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Then, if no one that is imperfect
can enter heaven, and none are perfect at death, can we not see 
what the work is that has to be done between death and the 
Resurrection?&nbsp; It is this work of purification, that the 
soul may be fitted for the vision of <span 
class="smcap">God</span> in heaven.&nbsp; And this is what S. 
Paul is speaking of in the text.&nbsp; The work begun in life, 
under the conditions of earth&rsquo;s life, shall not stop at 
death, but, under new conditions, shall be carried on to 
perfection until the day of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>So far, then, we may say that we are <!-- page 51--><a 
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>treading on 
sure ground.&nbsp; But when we go on to ask how shall this work 
and process of purification be effected, and what is the nature 
and method of it, we are approaching a stage in our enquiry about
which, it may be thought, nothing but conjecture remains, because
nothing has been revealed.&nbsp; But let us see what light may be
thrown upon this question.&nbsp; And, that we may narrow our 
enquiry within manageable limits, let us confine our attention 
for the present to the condition of those of whom it may with 
truth and reason be said that they died in the favour and grace 
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, died in good hope of 
salvation, surely trusting that their sins had been forgiven 
through the blood of Jesus Christ, and that, however imperfect 
and blemished with sin their lives had been, there was an assured
forgiveness for them and a good hope of eternal mercy.&nbsp; We 
will not define the exact limits of this reasonable hope, nor 
attempt to show who are within or beyond <!-- page 52--><a 
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>those 
limits.&nbsp; We will only, in general terms, speak of those who 
have entered upon the Intermediate Life in a condition such as 
would make them capable of perfect purification.&nbsp; Certainly 
it is impossible for any of us ever to say of any one absolutely 
that he is incapable of such progressive purification.&nbsp; It 
is not possible, in Christian charity, to pronounce sentence upon
any.&nbsp; And it may be, and we may indeed hope, that a vast 
number, a much larger proportion than many now imagine, will 
prove on their entrance into the Intermediate Life to be capable 
of such progress of effective purification as may fit them, each 
according to his measure, for the final salvation for which he 
may be qualified in that home where &ldquo;there are many 
mansions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When then does this purification begin?&nbsp; Does it begin 
with dying?&nbsp; That has been already disproved.&nbsp; But so 
prevalent is the popular belief that dying has a kind of 
cleansing power in itself, that it is well <!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>to touch upon
it once more.&nbsp; What is dying?&nbsp; It is simply the parting
of the soul from the body.&nbsp; The soul, up to the moment of 
death, dwells in the body.&nbsp; At death, in a moment it ceases 
to dwell in the body.&nbsp; But have not the pain, it may be 
asked, and the very agony of dying a chastening and purifying 
force, serving in themselves to crown repentance, and to achieve,
in the instant, the complete cleansing of the soul?&nbsp; Why 
should it be so?&nbsp; The pains which precede death are distinct
from dying, from what we may call the act of dying.&nbsp; The act
of dying is instantaneous.&nbsp; It is the moment, the crisis at 
which the soul takes its flight.&nbsp; The pains and agony which 
accompany the process leading up to death are not the pains and 
agony of dying at all.&nbsp; They are felt while the sick man is 
still living.&nbsp; They belong to his life, not to his 
death.&nbsp; At the moment of dying the sufferings are probably 
over.&nbsp; The body has just felt its last throb of sensible 
anguish, and, in the <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>crisis of the soul&rsquo;s departure,
is incapable of feeling pain, and therefore is incapable of the 
discipline of pain.&nbsp; And it is the discipline of pain alone 
that has any cleansing power.&nbsp; And the discipline of pain 
went on in life up to the moment, if it be so, of the dying, and 
then ceased.&nbsp; But it belonged, as the pain belonged, to the 
life, and not to the death.&nbsp; During the life, at many times 
in the life past, the wholesome discipline of pain may or may not
have been working a salutary change in the character, up to the 
very moment, perhaps, of death.&nbsp; But it ceased, as the pain 
ceased, at death.</p>
<p>This then we conclude, that the act of dying in itself, apart 
from the pain which may have preceded it, can have no moral 
effect, or work any moral change.&nbsp; Moral change, that is to 
say change of character, can only go on in life.&nbsp; Dying is a
physical operation, not a moral act.&nbsp; At death the 
possibility of change of character has stopped, so far as this 
life can be the <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>sphere of it.&nbsp; Life, not death, 
may be accompanied by cleansing, life on this side of death, and 
life on the other side of death, but not death, which is between,
the mere transition from life to life, from one mode of life to 
another.</p>
<p>The soul, therefore, after death begins just where it left 
off, just as life left it, no better, no worse.&nbsp; It passes 
into the unseen world, pardoned, it may be, by <span 
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> mercy, but yet no other than it 
was before it left the body.&nbsp; Even <span 
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> pardon does not change the 
character, nor yet remove the tendency to sin.&nbsp; That still 
remains, alas! even in the penitent.&nbsp; The consequences of 
our acts follow upon our acts, and form our character.&nbsp; As 
there is uniformity in the law of cause and effect in the realm 
of nature, so, in morals, is it the case with what we do.&nbsp; 
Let a man yield to a temptation:&mdash;is he as strong against 
that temptation after he has yielded to it as he would have been 
if he had not yielded to it?&nbsp; We know that <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>he is 
not.&nbsp; We know, by our own experience, that it needs a far 
greater and more strenuous effort to withstand the same 
temptation after previous yielding, than it did before.&nbsp; A 
man may repent and be pardoned, but he is what his sin has made 
him, weak and frail and prone to sin again.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> pardon has cancelled his guilt, 
but it has not removed his tendency, nor the moral consequences, 
which sin has wrought upon his character.</p>
<p>This then is what is meant when it is said that the soul, 
which has received the gracious pardon of <span 
class="smcap">God</span> before it left the body, is still, when 
it is launched into the Intermediate Life, clouded and disfigured
with the stains and imperfections which it had contracted in this
life.&nbsp; But <span class="smcap">God</span>, Who has begun the
good work of cleansing in this life, will carry it on in the life
unseen, until the soul be made perfect in the day of Jesus 
Christ.</p>
<p>Who of us, the best of us, does not feel within him the 
bitterness of the lingering <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>poison, which
sin has deposited in his heart?&nbsp; The holier a man is, the 
more he is conscious of his sinfulness.&nbsp; To the end of life 
this must be so; for there is no reaching perfection here.&nbsp; 
Those, chiefly, who have made most progress in the struggle 
against sin here, know how hateful it is.&nbsp; The higher men 
rise here in the divine life, the more they discern their 
imperfections, because they can better measure them by the 
measure of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> 
perfections.&nbsp; Each loftier level is but a new standpoint 
from which to lift the eyes, and view the peaks which soar upward
towards infinite elevations.&nbsp; For <span 
class="smcap">God</span> is holiness itself; and holiness is 
infinite, because <span class="smcap">God</span> is infinite.</p>

<p>The ground is now cleared for an answer to the 
question,&mdash;How is the purification of the soul effected in 
the Intermediate Life, and what is the nature of the 
process?&nbsp; We have seen, 1st, that this waiting time is not 
an idle time, but a time when something has to be done which can 
only be done then; 2nd, that what has to be done then is the work
of cleansing and purifying the soul, that it may be perfected for
the Beatific Vision in heaven; 3rd, that the souls of those who 
die in grace do yet, although fully pardoned, retain frailties of
character, the consequences of former sins; and, 4th, that dying 
in itself has no cleansing <!-- page 59--><a 
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>virtue 
whatever.&nbsp; What, then, are the conditions on which we may 
rely as grounds for legitimate inferences?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; First, then, memory survives death.&nbsp; In the 
narrative to which we have had occasion to refer more than once, 
Abraham is spoken of as bidding the rich man to remember.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Son, remember, that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy 
good things.&rdquo;&nbsp; The survival of memory is involved in 
the soul&rsquo;s consciousness of its own existence.&nbsp; And to
be conscious of our own existence is to be conscious that we are 
still the same persons that we were.&nbsp; Therefore we must be 
able to remember each successive moment what and who we were in 
the moment previous: so that the continuance of life involves the
continuance of the consciousness that it is ourselves that 
live.&nbsp; And this is memory.&nbsp; Bishop Butler, therefore, 
says, &ldquo;There is no reason for supposing that the exercise 
of our present powers of reflection is even suspended by the act 
of dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>But if we grant this, we may go further.&nbsp; What is 
it which makes memory in this life so imperfect?&nbsp; What is it
but the obtrusive hindrance of the body?&nbsp; The body is at the
mercy of the disturbing assaults of present impressions.&nbsp; 
Through ear, and eye, and touch external objects invade the mind,
and dispel and distract fixed and steadfast retrospect.&nbsp; The
present blots out the past.&nbsp; When we look back, scenes, and 
events, and words, and names fade from our memory, and are dimmed
by the haze of distance.&nbsp; The past is smothered by what has 
happened since.&nbsp; Only with a supreme effort, only in 
solitude, and then only imperfectly, can we recall what has gone 
by.&nbsp; But there, in the Intermediate State, when the soul 
dwells apart from the body, there, in the stillness of that 
&ldquo;cloistered and secluded life,&rdquo; the powers of memory 
will be undistracted and perfect.&nbsp; Even in this life, as we 
are told, some, in a great crisis, have seen at a single glance 
the <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
61</span>whole story of their past experience, and scenes and 
events, long since forgotten, have flashed in an instant before 
the mind, clear and vivid.&nbsp; Such clearness, we may well 
suppose, will the memory have in the Intermediate Life, as it 
recalls in that quiet stillness the actions of the past days on 
earth.&nbsp; Here is the first equipment then for the work of 
cleansing.&nbsp; All the evil things done in life, all the 
forgotten sins, in all their naked and uncouth colours, will 
stand undisguised before the mind.&nbsp; Nothing will escape the 
memory:&mdash;nothing.&nbsp; The days of childhood, of youth, of 
middle age, of elder years will give in their report.&nbsp; The 
soul will see things then as they are, no longer tricked out in 
false and flattering guise.&nbsp; There, in all their miserable 
littleness, and coarseness, and meanness, and cowardice, bygone 
sins will rise up before the stern tribunal of the unsparing 
memory, each as it was, each as it is, each as <span 
class="smcap">God</span> saw it at the time, each as <span 
class="smcap">God</span> sees it now.</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>2.&nbsp; But this is not all.&nbsp; The souls of those 
who have received forgiveness in life, and have passed into the 
Intermediate State in <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> 
favour, are, we must remember, &ldquo;with Christ&rdquo;; with 
Christ, however imperfect their characters, however scarred with 
traces of former wounds of sin.&nbsp; The malefactor&rsquo;s 
character at his death must have been full of blemishes, yet he 
was to be ushered and welcomed into Paradise by Christ 
Himself.&nbsp; S. Paul again and again spoke of his own departure
at death as that which would lead him into the presence of 
Christ.&nbsp; It may, however, be suggested that to be with 
Christ is to be with <span class="smcap">God</span>, and that the
vision of Christ must be the same thing as the vision of <span 
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; But the vision of <span 
class="smcap">God</span> is specially reserved for the redeemed 
in heaven, while the vision of Christ is possible in Paradise; 
for where Christ is there is the vision of Christ.&nbsp; For 
Christ has assumed the form of man, and was seen as Man by 
men.&nbsp; <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>But no man hath seen nor can see 
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; He dwells in the light 
which no man can approach unto.&nbsp; This is the vision of Him 
Who is to mortal eyes in His essence invisible.&nbsp; That vision
will be granted to the pure in heart in the infinite glory of 
Heaven, granted to those who shall have become fitted to behold 
Him in Heaven.&nbsp; But He Who took our flesh was manifest in 
the flesh, and was seen, and touched, and handled.&nbsp; In that 
same body He rose from the dead; in that same glorified body He 
ascended into Heaven, to fill all things.&nbsp; And so after His 
Ascension He was seen by S. Stephen <a name="citation63"></a><a 
href="#footnote63" class="citation">[63]</a> and by S. 
Paul.&nbsp; That human nature, therefore, we are to believe is so
present in Paradise that the sight of Him is vouchsafed even 
there to those who may be &ldquo;with Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What, then, follows from this?&nbsp; It follows that the soul 
will not only remember but also be able to judge of the 
past.&nbsp; For not only will it see its sins, <!-- page 64--><a 
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>but it will 
behold Christ also.&nbsp; It will see them, therefore, in the 
light of the perfect love, and most gracious sinlessness of Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; It will look upon sin&rsquo;s stains as they stand 
out in contrast with His purity, its ingratitude in contrast with
His compassion.&nbsp; He will be the atmosphere of the 
soul&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp; All the shame and dishonour, which 
in life the soul so complacently accepted, will then overwhelm it
with self-reproach and very bitter compunction.&nbsp; This is 
what is meant by seeing sins as <span class="smcap">God</span> 
sees them.&nbsp; It is to see them as the soul will see them 
under the sense of the Presence of the Holy Christ.&nbsp; Then 
will the soul know its guilt as it never knew it before.&nbsp; 
The guilt of sin will then be no bare expression, no conventional
formula, but a spiritual fact, not an abstract doctrine, but a 
concrete reality.</p>
<p>There will be revealed also to the soul the true meaning and 
significance of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> 
providences in life, which at the time were <!-- page 65--><a 
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>overlooked, 
or slighted, or strangely misunderstood.&nbsp; Tokens of <span 
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> love and care will then find 
their interpretation.&nbsp; The soul will see plainly why was 
this, wherefore was that, what that sorrow meant, what that loss,
that parting from one who was more dear than life.&nbsp; The many
perplexities which on earth misled the soul, of these the loving 
mercy and the gracious reason will then be seen.</p>
<p>And will there not be with the amazing surprise at these 
revelations a strange and unaccountable gladness?&nbsp; But, no 
less, at the thought of the soul&rsquo;s past blindness and 
persistence in ill-doing, will there not be an exquisite 
pain?&nbsp; And the soul&rsquo;s pain can be even more oppressive
than the pain of the body.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pain,&rdquo; it may be 
asked, &ldquo;in the Presence of Christ?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, 
indeed! pain, because in the Presence of Christ; pain in 
remembering, and in the consciousness, new to the soul, of its 
utter unworthiness before Christ.&nbsp; The soul cannot fully 
feel it now, but it <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>will feel it then.&nbsp; The fire of 
His love will kindle a fire of loving self-reproach.&nbsp; The 
weight of a heavy shame to think of the past, and to know now of 
His beauty, and His love, and His care, care for so careless a 
soul, love for a soul so loveless,&mdash;this will sting with an 
extreme severity the soul humbled before Him.&nbsp; And here we 
should do well to remember that, as the characters of each differ
almost infinitely, whereby there are innumerable shades and 
degrees of every conceivable distinction of merit and of sin, so 
the proportion and depth of the pains which the souls will feel 
will vary equally.&nbsp; The pains of no two souls will be 
exactly the same.&nbsp; They will be measured out, in subtle and 
exact aptness to each, according to its guilt or goodness, 
precisely as the process of its purification shall require.&nbsp;
There will be nothing unjust, nothing capricious in them.</p>
<p>And thus the pain will surely be a very wholesome pain.&nbsp; 
What could more deepen <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>penitence?&nbsp; The pain of 
self-reproach for unworthiness, and the pain of the sense of 
goodness in the Presence of Jesus Christ,&mdash;these two pains 
will purify the soul.&nbsp; No work of sanctification has ever 
been wrought in any soul without suffering.&nbsp; And none ever 
will.&nbsp; Even Christ Himself was not made perfect, as Man, 
without suffering.&nbsp; But the suffering in Paradise will be 
accompanied with an exquisite delight and joy.&nbsp; Do we not 
know, even here on earth, how near to each other very often are 
joy and sorrow?&nbsp; He whose spirit is swelling with a great 
gladness has often a sense of an undercurrent of great pain along
with it.&nbsp; How often tears and laughter go together!&nbsp; 
So, in that home of the disembodied soul, the very process of 
purification will be marked by an intensity of joy and an 
intensity of pain.&nbsp; They will be simultaneous.&nbsp; Nay! 
increasingly, it may be, they will deepen in the soul.&nbsp; The 
nearer the soul reaches its perfection the more <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>abounding may
be its gladness, and the more piercing its compunction.&nbsp; 
Thus its very anguish will be a delight, and its very delight 
will be an anguish, and these will proceed, and advance, and 
increase until the soul is ripe for the Blessed Vision of <span 
class="smcap">God</span> in Heaven.&nbsp; For He Which began the 
good work in the soul, here, in life, will, we may be very 
confident, never abandon it, nor suspend it, but will continue it
and perfect it all through the after life, even until the day of 
Jesus Christ.</p>

even <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself cannot help 
them.&nbsp; On the supposition that the prerogative of free will,
once for all given to man, must be respected by <span 
class="smcap">God</span>, we are driven to the belief that <span 
class="smcap">God</span> cannot force the will.&nbsp; It is not 
that <span class="smcap">God</span> changes towards them.&nbsp; 
It is not necessary to suppose that He is even punishing 
them.&nbsp; He may still be in Himself all that He is to all, 
full of love towards them, full of pity, full of mercy.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;His mercy is over all His works.&rdquo;&nbsp; He can no 
more cease to be a Father to every man than He can cease to be 
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; He hates nothing that He 
has made.&nbsp; But if the very knowledge and thought of <span 
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> longsuffering patience serves 
only to harden and to exasperate, if it only stirs in the lost 
soul deeper pangs of inexorable hatred, <!-- page 71--><a 
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
71</span>then,&mdash;man being man and <span 
class="smcap">God</span> being <span 
class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;what can <span 
class="smcap">God</span> do?&nbsp; It is they who reject <span 
class="smcap">God</span>, not <span class="smcap">God</span> Who 
is rejecting them.&nbsp; It is they who spurn Him, not He Who 
chastises them.&nbsp; He does not banish them from His Presence: 
it is they who banish Him from their presence.&nbsp; And if this 
defiance against <span class="smcap">God</span> survives and 
lasts, if, as ages pass, it becomes more resolutely inveterate 
and set, what power can stop it, what love can soften it?&nbsp; 
And if it is never to be pacified, and never yields, what shall 
hinder it from going on up to and beyond the Day of 
Judgment?&nbsp; It may be said that such utter determination is a
moral impossibility, that no will of man could finally defy and 
resist the love of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; If that 
be so, well!&nbsp; But on the assumption that it is not 
impossible, the inference which has been drawn is inevitable.</p>
<p>But there are others who in life have never heard of Christ, 
the millions of heathen in all ages and all lands since <!-- page
72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>the 
world began, of whom it may truly be said that they never had a 
chance of salvation.&nbsp; To these may be added many who have 
indeed fallen in with Christianity, but with a Christianity of 
such a sort, presented to them in such a way, in such a form, and
under such circumstances as almost naturally to create in their 
minds a really honest doubt and distrust of it.&nbsp; What shall 
be said of these honest unbelievers, and, scarcely through their 
own fault, blind?&nbsp; As to these, let us ask whether the 
doctrine of the Intermediate State can help to give us some 
better hope.</p>
<p>In the text, <a name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72" 
class="citation">[72]</a> we are told that Christ was put to 
death upon the Cross in the flesh, but was quickened in His human
<!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>Spirit, that is to say, that after His human Spirit left
His Body it was still quick or alive.&nbsp; We know, from the 
Gospel of S. Luke, whither His human Spirit went.&nbsp; It went 
to Paradise.&nbsp; S. Peter now tells us what His Spirit did 
there.&nbsp; He tells us that it preached unto other spirits, and
he names the spirits of those who for 120 years, while Noah was 
building the ark, were disobedient.&nbsp; They had rejected Noah,
&ldquo;the preacher of righteousness&rdquo; <a 
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73" 
class="citation">[73]</a> as S. Peter calls him; and now a 
greater Preacher went to preach to them.&nbsp; Further, we are 
told, that they were &ldquo;in prison.&rdquo;&nbsp; The word 
should rather be rendered &ldquo;in safe keeping,&rdquo; that is 
to say, still waiting, under <span 
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> care, for this visit of 
Christ&rsquo;s human Spirit, when He should preach to them.&nbsp;
Why the spirits of these men, who lived before the flood, are 
singled out for special mention, is a question that does not 
really bear upon the point which we have in hand.&nbsp; <!-- page
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>And 
we had better keep to that point, and not be tempted to 
digress.&nbsp; What then follows from this?&nbsp; Two things are 
clear,&mdash;first, that from as far back as the days before the 
flood, that is to say, from the very beginning of human life on 
earth, souls in the Intermediate State had been waiting in safe 
keeping all these many thousand years; and, secondly, that the 
disembodied soul of our Lord Jesus Christ visited them there and 
preached to them.&nbsp; Assuming that these souls had repented, 
however late, before they died, still we learn that something 
more than repentance was needful to them.&nbsp; In this case, it 
is clear that instruction was given to them.&nbsp; It would not 
have been given if it had not been necessary.&nbsp; And what 
instruction?&nbsp; Christ &ldquo;proclaimed,&rdquo; we are told, 
to them.&nbsp; What did He proclaim?&nbsp; Surely the good news 
of the Gospel, <a name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74" 
class="citation">[74]</a> which He had been proclaiming <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>on 
earth by the voice of the Apostles.&nbsp; What else did He make 
known than the mystery of His Incarnation and the Atonement which
He had wrought out upon the Cross, in bearing the sins of men, 
and their sins, too, who had so long been waiting in the 
Intermediate State, to hear it to their salvation?&nbsp; S. 
Peter, therefore, in another place, says, &ldquo;For this 
cause,&rdquo; that is, because Christ will Himself be the Judge 
of the living and the dead,&mdash;&ldquo;for this cause was 
<i>the Gospel</i> preached even to the dead.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75" 
class="citation">[75]</a></p>
<p>Here, then, we have a set of facts which throw light upon some
of the dark places of that unknown and unseen land, the 
Intermediate State.&nbsp; If we do justice to our Bibles we must 
regard these as facts, whether we can fully explain them or 
not.&nbsp; Scriptural facts they certainly are.&nbsp; What, then,
can we learn from them?&nbsp; First, we seem to learn 
this,&mdash;that some provision is made in the Intermediate <!-- 
page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
76</span>State for the salvation of those souls who in this life 
never heard of Christ, never had a chance, as we say, of 
salvation.&nbsp; And when we think of it, does it not seem to 
belong to <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> eternal justice 
that souls should not be condemned for that which they could not 
help?&nbsp; Every human soul must have had a chance of knowing 
Christ, before it can justly be punished for the consequences of 
not knowing Him.&nbsp; Countless millions in all ages, since the 
world began, in our own land, and in other lands, have never 
heard the good news of Jesus Christ in life.&nbsp; It is not so 
with us.&nbsp; With them it is and has been so.&nbsp; Christ 
preached to those who in safe keeping had been waiting 
long.&nbsp; Then is it not possible for such as those in all ages
to receive the teaching in the Intermediate Life which they never
received in this?&nbsp; Why should Christ preach to those and not
to these?</p>
<p>This hope helps to solve that harassing enigma which perplexes
and oppresses so <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>many of us,&mdash;I mean, as to the 
condition and future destiny of the heathen, and the outcast, and
the blind, and the ignorant.&nbsp; There, in that stillness of 
the disembodied life, souls may be taught and trained to know 
what they never could know in this life on earth, the wonders and
the blessings of the life in Christ.</p>
<p>And, besides, do we not at least learn this from 
Christ&rsquo;s preaching to these souls, that intercourse and 
communication is <i>possible</i> in the life after death, and 
will take place?&nbsp; And this suggests another aspect of the 
work in that life, besides the work of progressive cleansing and 
perfecting.&nbsp; The souls of the faithful rest from their 
labours.&nbsp; Yes! but they have also a work to do which can 
only be done then, the work of the soul&rsquo;s 
purification.&nbsp; The work, however, which they can do for 
others is better than that which can be done for 
themselves.&nbsp; What can they do for the souls of others?&nbsp;
Can they not do what Christ&rsquo;s human spirit <!-- page 
78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
78</span>did?&nbsp; Here on earth men are charged, not only with 
the care of their own souls, but with the care of the souls of 
others also.&nbsp; And why should they not be ambassadors for 
Christ there, if Christ&rsquo;s work has to be done there?&nbsp; 
Here on earth He uses imperfect men to proclaim His Gospel.&nbsp;
There, in that after life, if His Gospel is to be proclaimed to 
those that never heard it in this life, why should He not employ 
souls also, not yet perfected, upon the same happy task?</p>
<p>And may not this charge, laid on ministering souls in the 
Intermediate Life, help to solve another mystery&mdash;the 
mystery of many an early and, as we might think, untimely 
death?&nbsp; How often do we see a life cut short at the very 
climax of its best powers, in the very midst of its noblest 
service!&nbsp; All the earlier days had been directed, and had 
contributed to the perfection of the instrument, and then, just 
when its work was doing, came the sudden end.&nbsp; Was it not so
to our Blessed <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Lord Himself?&nbsp; May it not be 
said with due reverence that, if only His human life on earth had
been prolonged, His teaching, and His miracles, and His 
sinlessness, and His love must have swayed and melted the hearts 
of men, even of those who so long and so stubbornly withstood 
Him?&nbsp; We might so think.&nbsp; But, just when His young life
was at its prime of human excellence, He died, and His human 
Spirit passed to preach salvation to souls in the spirit 
land.&nbsp; So are souls, it may be, taken from us at the summit 
of their ripeness, but only to be transferred to another scene, 
and to be employed upon other work.&nbsp; Their labours change, 
but their works indeed do follow with them to that land where 
other souls of those who knew not Christ here may learn to know 
Him there, and knowing Him may choose Him, and choosing Him may 
be His and He theirs even to the end.</p>

<p>The Scriptural doctrine of the Intermediate Life, as I have 
tried, so far, to set it forth, is a very different thing from 
what our Twenty-second Article calls &ldquo;The Romish Doctrine 
concerning Purgatory.&rdquo;&nbsp; The word 
&ldquo;purgatory&rdquo; simply means the sphere or life of 
cleansing.&nbsp; The Intermediate State, therefore, during which 
the soul is being purified and fitted for the vision of <span 
class="smcap">God</span> in Heaven may be legitimately called 
&ldquo;a purgatory.&rdquo;&nbsp; But &ldquo;The Romish Doctrine 
concerning Purgatory&rdquo; means much more than this.&nbsp; It 
is a belief which, originating in what was true and Scriptural, 
gradually became so overlaid with subsequent additions, that the 
original <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>truth was at length buried and lost 
sight of.&nbsp; What the Twenty-second Article condemns is not 
any and every conceivable doctrine concerning Purgatory, but the 
Romish doctrine only.&nbsp; And here it is well to note that all 
false beliefs which have had for any length of time a wide 
currency among men have been founded upon and have retained in 
them some element of truth.&nbsp; This it is which enabled them 
to survive: this and nothing else gives to error its 
vitality.&nbsp; These false beliefs are not mere error, but 
contain truth and error mixed together.&nbsp; The error perverts 
and makes void the truth; but without the truth the error could 
not live.</p>
<p>In the case of the doctrine of Purgatory, the true and 
Scriptural doctrine of the progressive purification of the soul 
in the Intermediate State is the element of truth on which has 
been based the Romish Doctrine of Purgatory.&nbsp; Wherein then 
lies the error of it?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In the first place, whereas the Bible <!-- page 
82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
82</span>teaches, as we have seen, that every soul at death 
enters the Intermediate State, the souls of the greatest saints 
as well as the souls of the greatest sinners, &ldquo;the Romish 
Doctrine&rdquo; teaches that the souls of very many never enter 
the Intermediate State at all.&nbsp; The souls of the holy 
patriarchs of old, of Christian martyrs, and of canonized Saints,
it is held, pass straight to heaven.&nbsp; On the other hand, the
souls of those who die in mortal sin, and of excommunicated 
persons are believed to go straight to hell.&nbsp; Thus 
practically the Intermediate State is cancelled for these two 
classes.&nbsp; There remains, therefore, only one class which is 
supposed to enter the Intermediate State, those namely, who have 
died in venial sin.&nbsp; And since it is part of the Romish 
doctrine to regard Paradise as the same thing as Heaven, and to 
hold that the souls which alone enter Purgatory, after suffering 
due torments, pass direct out of Purgatory into Paradise or 
Heaven, it follows that in the <!-- page 83--><a 
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Intermediate 
State are only those who are actually undergoing, for the time 
appointed, the pains of Purgatory.&nbsp; For all, therefore, 
eventually the Intermediate State is terminated at some time on 
this side of the Day of Judgment.&nbsp; Hence it came about that 
those who rejected the Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory 
rejected along with it the doctrine of the Intermediate State, 
since, virtually, Purgatory and the Intermediate State had been 
regarded as practically one and the same thing, as indeed they 
were in duration conterminous.&nbsp; In rejecting the one 
therefore, men unhappily but almost naturally rejected the other 
also.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Further, the pains which are felt in the process of 
purification, as has been shown, spring from within the soul 
itself, and are not necessarily or for all inflicted as a torment
or punishment from without.&nbsp; Rather they arise from the 
soul&rsquo;s own action upon itself, from its own pangs of shame 
and self-abasement, all deepened <!-- page 84--><a 
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>and made more
poignant by the ever increasing sense of the love of Jesus 
Christ, then as never before apprehended, and by the holy vision 
of His perfections.&nbsp; Thereby, as they gaze on Him, they are 
changed by the influence of the sight of Him, into greater 
likeness to Him.&nbsp; On the other hand, contrast with these the
nature of the pains which the Romish Doctrine assigns to the 
souls in Purgatory.&nbsp; They are held in all cases to be penal,
that is to say, inflicted by <span class="smcap">God</span> as 
punishment.&nbsp; The souls are said to suffer torments! <a 
name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84" 
class="citation">[84]</a>&nbsp; Moreover these torments, as is 
taught in Roman Catholic treatises on the subject, are caused by 
literal and material flames, by actual fires which would feed on 
and consume corporeal substances such as the human body.&nbsp; 
But what enters the Intermediate State is the soul only, not the 
body: and, in the nature of things, the sufferings of the 
incorporeal part of our being can only <!-- page 85--><a 
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>be themselves
incorporeal.&nbsp; The pains of the spirit can only be spiritual 
pains.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Again, the &ldquo;Romish Doctrine concerning 
Purgatory&rdquo; is closely bound up with what are called in the 
Thirty-first Article &ldquo;the Sacrifices of Masses,&rdquo; and 
with the sale of &ldquo;Pardons&rdquo; or Indulgences, named in 
the Twenty-second Article.&nbsp; The character of the Romish 
doctrine, as of every other doctrine, must be tested by what has 
grown with its growth.&nbsp; It was held that by these 
&ldquo;Sacrifices of Masses&rdquo; and &ldquo;Indulgences&rdquo; 
souls, one by one, were released from Purgatorial fires sooner 
than, without their aid, they could be delivered, and thus were 
at once admitted to Paradise or Heaven.</p>
<p>What, however, does the Thirty-first Article precisely mean by
&ldquo;Sacrifices of Masses&rdquo;?&nbsp; The expression is 
peculiar, and appears to have been designedly so shaped in order 
to be clearly distinguished from what is meant by the Sacrifice 
in the Mass, or Holy Communion.&nbsp; For that <!-- page 86--><a 
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>the Holy 
Communion has been held and taught by our chief English Divines 
to be a Sacrifice cannot well be disputed. <a 
name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86" 
class="citation">[86]</a>&nbsp; But the term &ldquo;Sacrifices of
Masses&rdquo; was intended to signify what were called, at the 
time when the Article was drawn up, &ldquo;Private Masses,&rdquo;
which were offered chiefly for souls in Purgatory, and in return 
for money payment.&nbsp; The Article refers to modes of speaking 
prevalent on the lips of men at the time.&nbsp; It condemns that 
which was &ldquo;<i>commonly said</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what was 
it that was &ldquo;commonly said&rdquo;?&nbsp; It was commonly 
said that, while Christ&rsquo;s death on <!-- page 87--><a 
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>the Cross was
indeed a propitiation for original or birth sin, on the other 
hand for daily sins, committed after Baptism, another 
propitiatory sacrifice was needed, <i>viz.</i>, the 
&ldquo;Sacrifice of the Mass.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus the Sacrifice of 
the Mass, which is not the same thing as the Sacrifice <i>in</i> 
the Mass, was regarded as an addition to and distinct from the 
Sacrifice on the Cross, as indeed a repetition of it, having a 
propitiatory value of its own, which the Sacrifice on the Cross 
had not; just as though it were what Bishop Gardiner, in 
repudiating it, described as &ldquo;a new Redemption.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87" 
class="citation">[87]</a>&nbsp; Hence it came about that the 
belief arose that Masses offered for specific purposes had more 
virtue for those purposes than <!-- page 88--><a 
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>what was 
called &ldquo;a Common Mass.&rdquo;&nbsp; The practice, 
therefore, of offering &ldquo;private Masses&rdquo; for souls in 
Purgatory, as it was very lucrative, so it became very 
prevalent.&nbsp; Thus spiritual things were used for the purpose 
of bringing large money gains to the Chantry Priests, and what 
should be, and we may surely affirm was meant to be, for the 
common benefit of all became the narrow privilege of the 
few.&nbsp; For rich men could provide Masses for their dead 
friends and for themselves after death, which it was quite out of
the power of the poor to provide. <a name="citation88"></a><a 
href="#footnote88" class="citation">[88]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
89</span>4.&nbsp; But a word also must be said about 
&ldquo;Indulgences.&rdquo;&nbsp; An Indulgence was an abatement 
or remission granted by the Church&rsquo;s authority of some part
of the temporal penance imposed by that authority upon an evil 
doer.&nbsp; If the guilty person should show sincere proofs of 
penitence, or by liberal giving of alms made satisfactory 
recompense for wrongs done, his penance might be eased, or the 
term of his excommunication shortened, and his Church privileges 
partly or wholly restored.&nbsp; It may well be understood how 
all this might be very wisely and fitly done.&nbsp; The authority
which inflicted the penance may rightly have been entrusted with 
the power also of mitigating or removing it.&nbsp; But gradually 
this remission of the temporal punishment for sins done in the 
past became applicable, not seldom, to future sin also: and it 
soon was no uncommon thing to grant Indulgences for 500, or 
10,000, and even for 50,000 years.&nbsp; And, since these long 
periods of <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>years would, of course, extend beyond
any man&rsquo;s term of life on earth, it was obvious that they 
were intended to secure the remission, not indeed of the guilt of
the sin, but of the temporal punishment of sin during all these 
years in Purgatory.&nbsp; Thus it was supposed that the best 
possible provision was made whereby the duration of the long 
years of torments due for sin in Purgatory might be 
curtailed.&nbsp; But worse remained.&nbsp; The Papal Court needed
treasure.&nbsp; And in an evil moment permission was given that 
these Indulgences might be sold for money.&nbsp; Thus grew up an 
unholy traffic, which, as we all know, first roused in Germany 
the storm of the Reformation.&nbsp; Subsequently, the Papal 
authorities so far yielded as to forbid all taking of money for 
these Indulgences.&nbsp; But the system itself had meantime taken
deep root.&nbsp; It continued, and continues to this day.&nbsp; 
It was, however, at its worst when the Twenty-second Article was 
drawn up.&nbsp; <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Can we be surprised that it sternly 
condemned it?&nbsp; It is all a pitiful history.&nbsp; But it was
necessary to refer to it in order both to show how the growth of 
the Romish Doctrine of Purgatory gradually gathered round it 
mischievous accretions, and also to prove how little the belief, 
that in the Intermediate State there is a progressive advance of 
the soul in holiness towards perfection, is like the Romish 
teaching and practice.</p>
<p>But it would be an act of disloyalty to the truth, and of 
cowardice into the bargain, if we should abandon or minimize a 
truth because it has been by some corrupted and perverted.&nbsp; 
Many a truth which has come down to us may have lost some of the 
fresh lustre of its early purity.&nbsp; But all the same, if it 
is the truth we cannot let it go.&nbsp; And that truth which 
tells us something of the land, now beyond our sight, to which 
our dear ones have already passed, which we shall each of us 
ourselves soon enter&mdash;the truth which <!-- page 92--><a 
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span><span 
class="smcap">God</span> has made known to us in Holy Scripture 
about this land, we cannot afford to ignore and disregard.&nbsp; 
Nothing is easier than to discredit such a truth by raising the 
cry of Popery.&nbsp; It is one of the penalties which those have 
to pay who seek to disentangle the truth which He has in His 
Church revealed from the untruth which has wrapped it round.</p>
<p>But we must not shrink from this duty.&nbsp; In days when 
principles are questioned, and almost all truths disputed, we 
must, at all hazards, learn to keep our sight clear and our 
footing steady.&nbsp; For the Lord is our Light and our 
Salvation.&nbsp; Whom then shall we fear?&nbsp; The Lord is the 
strength of our life: of whom then shall we be afraid? <a

<p>We must now bring to a close the discussion which has been 
occupying our attention: not that everything has been said that 
can or ought to be said about it; for the interest of the subject
grows with the handling of it, as the various features of it open
out to view.</p>
<p>So far we have been dealing with the condition of the faithful
dead as it affects themselves, with the mode of their own 
conscious life in the Intermediate State, and with the nature of 
their own progressive advance towards perfection.&nbsp; But there
is another aspect of the question, about which nothing has 
hitherto been said, I mean, their relation to us who are still 
living on earth.&nbsp; A few words, and <!-- page 94--><a 
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>they must be 
very few, must be said on this point.&nbsp; It is asked, for 
example, whether the veil has completely shut out all knowledge 
of what is passing on earth from those who have gone to their 
rest.&nbsp; No doubt, we can know very little about this.&nbsp; 
But, at all events, we do not know enough to warrant us in saying
with any confidence that they are aware of nothing that is going 
on here.&nbsp; It is true that, as has been said, the door that 
opens between this life and that life only &ldquo;open 
inwards,&rdquo; and that none have come back to tell us what in 
that after life they knew about us and about our doings on 
earth.&nbsp; Yet this ignorance of ours is not the same thing as 
knowledge of the contrary, any more than silence is always 
equivalent to denial.&nbsp; Because we cannot see with our eyes, 
nor hear with our ears, and cannot, by our actual senses, put the
question to the test, we are not on this account justified in 
denying.&nbsp; Do we not know almost nothing as to the limits of 
the powers of the <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>spirit world?&nbsp; All we can say, 
so far as reason can be our guide, is this, that it is 
<i>possible</i> that souls in the Intermediate State, if they are
conscious of themselves and of their present condition, if they 
retain memory, if they have means of holding intercourse with one
another, may have means of knowing what goes on here: I say that 
reason will tell us that this is at least possible, and that it 
is quite impossible to prove the contrary.</p>
<p>But does the Bible throw any light upon this mysterious 
subject?&nbsp; I think it does.&nbsp; It will be remembered how, 
in the narrative of the rich man and Lazarus, Abraham is made to 
say to the rich man, &ldquo;They have Moses and the Prophets, let
them hear them.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may ask, how could Abraham, who 
lived more than 400 years before the birth of Moses, have known 
of the existence of Moses, if there were no possible means of 
communication, by which occurrences on earth could be made known 
in the unseen <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>world where Abraham was?&nbsp; What 
could he know of the prophets who lived more than a thousand 
years after his time, if no possible communication could find its
way to that other world? <a name="citation96"></a><a 
href="#footnote96" class="citation">[96]</a>&nbsp; And we may 
trust this inference because, in a narrative of this kind, 
whether it be historical or not, it is not to be supposed that 
our Lord would have introduced a false detail.</p>
<p>Let us, however, turn to another passage.&nbsp; In the scene 
on the Mount of the Transfiguration there appeared, talking with 
Christ, Moses and Elijah.&nbsp; In what condition were they 
present?&nbsp; They were <!-- page 97--><a 
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>still in the 
Intermediate State.&nbsp; The general Resurrection had not, and 
has not yet, come.&nbsp; &ldquo;In glory&rdquo; they 
appeared.&nbsp; Yes! some outward clothing, as of a bodily form, 
gloriously radiant was thrown round them, so that they became 
visible for the time to the eyes of the three disciples.&nbsp; 
But in no resurrection bodies did they come; for in those they 
could not yet present themselves, since they had not yet received
them.&nbsp; And what was the theme of their conversation?&nbsp; 
They spoke, we are told, with Christ concerning the exodus or 
&ldquo;death, which He should accomplish at 
Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; But how could they speak fitly of this 
great theme, if they had no knowledge of the circumstances which 
were leading to it, of the nature of Christ&rsquo;s Incarnate 
Life on earth, and something at least or the real significance, 
known fully to the mind of <span class="smcap">God</span> only, 
of His approaching death?&nbsp; They must have known not only of 
each other, who and what they had been historically <!-- page 
98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>in 
their own generation, but also what was now passing on earth, the
course and connection of prophecies and types, and the succession
of events in history which had led up to this climax of the 
fulness of time.</p>
<p>Thus we see that the hearts of these two 
visitants,&mdash;visitants not from Heaven, but from 
Paradise,&mdash;were fastened with a keen interest and strained 
attention upon the unfolding of that wondrous Life of 
Christ.&nbsp; His works and words were the theme of their adoring
contemplation.&nbsp; May we not learn then, that what these two 
great Saints could do was, therefore, at least a possible thing 
to do, and, according to the will of <span 
class="smcap">God</span>, a thing which others might also do? <a 
name="citation98"></a><a href="#footnote98" 
class="citation">[98]</a>&nbsp; If so, the barrier <!-- page 
99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
99</span>between Paradise and earth is so far transparent on that
further side, that what <span class="smcap">God</span> permits 
souls in the Intermediate Life to know, that they do actually see
and know of the occurrences that are passing here. <a 
name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99" 
class="citation">[99]</a></p>
<p>But I must hasten to the answer of another question.&nbsp; Do 
they pray for us?&nbsp; Surely that question is as good as 
answered by what has just been said.&nbsp; If those who have gone
from our sight are still permitted to know what it may be good 
for them to know of the trials and sorrows, the hopes and fears, 
the temptations and the warfare to which we, whom they loved so 
well and still love, are exposed on earth, we are sure that they 
take thought of us and pray for us.&nbsp; Shall not they whose 
eyes are opened, <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>now that they are with Christ, care 
for and pray for those whom they have left behind, tossing still 
upon the troubled seas, and buffeted by the vexing winds and 
storms of this earthly life?</p>
<p>They are, moreover, &ldquo;with Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; What does
this really imply,&mdash;to be &ldquo;with Christ&rdquo;?&nbsp; 
It must mean at least this, that, where Christ is, there is the 
Church.&nbsp; And Christ, though He has ascended to the Right 
Hand of <span class="smcap">God</span>, is still in a true sense 
in Paradise also.&nbsp; For &ldquo;He filleth all in all.&rdquo; 
<a name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a" 
class="citation">[100a]</a>&nbsp; S. Stephen, before his death, 
prayed, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our 
Lord, therefore, must have been there in Paradise to receive 
it.&nbsp; S. Paul, long after our Lord&rsquo;s Ascension, knew 
that to die was better than to live, because it was to be absent 
from the body and present with the Lord. <a 
name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b" 
class="citation">[100b]</a>&nbsp; But if Christ is there, He must
be the object of the worship of those who are also there.&nbsp; 
So then if Christ be there, and the Church <!-- page 101--><a 
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>is there, 
and worship is offered there, then it follows that the whole 
energy of Church life is there.&nbsp; The souls in Paradise are 
not so many isolated and individual units.&nbsp; The Church 
unites them.&nbsp; They are organised in the exercise of worship,
sustained, as it surely is, in unfailing and perpetual 
intensity.&nbsp; As the incense of our worship rises here, it 
blends with the incense that ascends to Christ there.&nbsp; The 
Church is militant on earth, it is expectant in Paradise, it will
be hereafter triumphant in Heaven.&nbsp; Yet these are not three 
Churches, but one Church.&nbsp; And this helps us to see more 
clearly what is meant by the Communion of Saints.&nbsp; The 
Church on earth and the Church in Paradise are one, and one 
thrill of spiritual communion vibrates through its members there 
and here.</p>
<p>But is prayer to be one sided?&nbsp; Communion is not one 
sided.&nbsp; And communion implies that what they do for us, we 
should also do for them.&nbsp; This brings us to one <!-- page 
102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
102</span>more question.&nbsp; May we, then, pray for those who 
have passed on before us?&nbsp; Let us plainly say that there is 
every reason for and none against the practice.&nbsp; We have in 
favour of it the sanction of Bible witness, of primitive Church 
custom, of Christian and human instinct.</p>
<p>In the Jewish synagogues in our Lord&rsquo;s time, prayers for
the dead formed part of the service. <a name="citation102"></a><a
href="#footnote102" class="citation">[102]</a>&nbsp; Our Lord 
therefore, Who regularly frequented the synagogue worship, must 
have been present at times when prayers for the dead were 
used.&nbsp; If He had disapproved of such prayers, He must have 
condemned the use of them.&nbsp; But did He?&nbsp; He did 
not.&nbsp; We have then His tacit sanction of them.&nbsp; S. Paul
again, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, must have warned the Gentiles 
against the practice, unless he approved of it.&nbsp; But so far 
from that, there is every reason to suppose that he himself 
prayed for Onesiphorus.&nbsp; According to the best commentators,
Onesiphorus <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>was dead when S. Paul wrote the 
words quoted in the text, &ldquo;The Lord grant unto him that he 
may find mercy of the Lord in that day,&rdquo; <i>viz.</i>, in 
the Day of Judgment. <a name="citation103a"></a><a 
href="#footnote103a" class="citation">[103a]</a>&nbsp; He does 
not pray for temporal blessings, for health, or even for 
grace.&nbsp; If it was too late to pray for these things, this 
omission is quite intelligible.</p>
<p>The earliest Church Liturgies contained in them prayers for 
the dead. <a name="citation103b"></a><a href="#footnote103b" 
class="citation">[103b]</a>&nbsp; And the earliest Christian 
writers, as well as the inscriptions on tombs bear such witness 
to the existence of this primitive practice, that it cannot be 
disputed.&nbsp; It is true that our English Prayer Book neither 
expressly sanctions nor yet expressly forbids these 
intercessions.&nbsp; But in the Liturgy, in the Litany, and in 
the Burial Service, prayers occur which appear to have been 
purposely so worded, as to lend themselves to a reference in the 
minds of worshippers to the faithful dead, if any should desire 
so to <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>apply them.&nbsp; Bishop Cosin, one 
of the chief compilers of our present Prayer Book, writes that 
the words, &ldquo;that we and Thy whole Church may obtain 
remission of our sins, and all other benefits of His 
Passion,&rdquo; occurring in our Liturgy, are to be understood to
refer as well to &ldquo;those who have been here before,&rdquo; 
that is to say, who have died in the Lord, as to those 
&ldquo;that are now members of it,&rdquo; that is, who still are 
living. <a name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104" 
class="citation">[104]</a></p>
<p>And is not the custom reasonable?&nbsp; Are we to pray for 
those whom we dearly love up to the very last moment of their 
life, and then for ever to refrain?&nbsp; We could understand 
this on the supposition that death was the end of all things, or 
that at death there followed an immediate heaven or an instant 
hell; but not if the process of purification and of real Church 
life are continuing after death.&nbsp; And Christian instinct 
urges it.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> is a Father.&nbsp;
As children we ought to tell Him all that is <!-- page 105--><a 
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>in our 
heart.&nbsp; Whatever we may rightly desire we may rightly pray 
for.&nbsp; It is only that which we ought not to desire that we 
ought not to pray for.&nbsp; It is not right to pray that they 
may, as by a miracle, be restored to us; that is not the will of 
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Nor is it right that we 
should seek by occult and forbidden ways to hold converse with 
them.&nbsp; But we may surely ask for them what S. Paul asked for
his friend, that they may find mercy in that day, that they may 
have rest and peace and light and refreshment, the joy of 
Christ&rsquo;s Presence, and the gladness of a blessed 
Resurrection.</p>
<p>And now these words must be brought to a close.&nbsp; The 
arguments which have been urged rest upon the very language of 
Holy Scripture, or upon legitimate inferences from it.&nbsp; What
then?&nbsp; If they are worthy of trust, to accept them is to rob
death of half its fears and alarms.&nbsp; It is the unknown that 
inspires terror.&nbsp; To know but a little more than we before 
<!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
106</span>knew of the land in which those who have gone before 
now sojourn, is to gather fresh courage to face it with less 
misgiving for them and for ourselves.&nbsp; They have passed on, 
but they await us there.&nbsp; They are only hidden from us for a
little while.&nbsp; Their voices are silent.&nbsp; But their life
is as real a life as ours.&nbsp; No dull oblivion weighs them 
down.&nbsp; They live and think and see and know,&mdash;know, it 
may be, more of us than we think, know as much of us as it is for
their happiness to know.&nbsp; A little while and we also shall 
know as they know, and see as they see, in the home and resting 
place of vision and of peace.</p>

the custom among the Jews of reclining instead of sitting at a 
banquet.&nbsp; The guest was stretched upon a couch, his left 
elbow resting upon a cushion close to the table, his feet being 
towards the outer side of the couch, which was away from the 
table.&nbsp; By slightly bending back his head he could touch 
with it the breast of the guest on his left hand, and speak to 
him in a low voice.&nbsp; Thus S. John bent back upon our 
Lord&rsquo;s breast at the Last Supper to ask Him, &ldquo;Lord,

leant upon His breast at supper.&rdquo;&nbsp; To sit therefore,

Peter meant to assert, that it was by the special operation of 
<span class="smcap">God</span> the Holy Ghost that our Lord, 
after He died upon the Cross, still lived.&nbsp; But this 
rendering entirely destroys the evident antithesis which is 
marked in the contrast between &ldquo;put to death&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;quickened,&rdquo; and between &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; That antithesis limits the effect of 
Christ&rsquo;s death to His human Body, while His human Spirit

<p><a name="footnote86"></a><a href="#citation86" 
class="footnote">[86]</a>&nbsp; In the Holy Communion the priest 
and the people offer to the Father &ldquo;the one full, perfect, 
and sufficient Sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for the sins
of the whole world.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Christian Society is called 
in 1 Peter ii. 9, a &ldquo;royal <i>priesthood</i>,&rdquo; 
(&Beta;&alpha;&sigma;&#943;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;&upsilon;
&iota;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&epsilon;&upsilon;&mu;&alpha;), 
and in Rev. i. 6 &ldquo;kings and <i>priests to 
God</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
(&Beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf; 
&kappa;&alpha;&iota; 
&iota;&epsilon;&rho;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;); and as 
&iota;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&epsilon;&upsilon;&mu;&alpha; and
&iota;&epsilon;&rho;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf; are sacrificial 
terms, it is to be inferred that a Sacrifice is really offered by
them.&nbsp; As Christ perpetually, being a &ldquo;Priest 
forever,&rdquo; and therefore &ldquo;having of necessity 
something to offer&rdquo; for ever (Heb. viii. 3), presents in 
the Holy Place not made with hands, in Heaven itself, the 
Sacrifice of Himself before the eyes of the Father, so, at every 
Altar on earth, the &ldquo;kings and priests&rdquo; being a 
sacrificing priesthood, represent and commemorate the same 
sacrifice and none other, a sacrifice which never can be 
repeated.</p>
<p><a name="footnote87"></a><a href="#citation87" 
class="footnote">[87]</a>&nbsp; See Dr. Maclear on the Articles, 
p. 368.&nbsp; If the Sacrifice on the Cross served one purpose 
and effected one propitiation, and the Sacrifice of the Mass 
another, then the inference is that they were themselves, so far,
different things.&nbsp; It was the same Body of Christ which was 
offered in each case, but the sacrifices of the same Body were 
different.&nbsp; Therefore the Sacrifice of the Mass was a 
repetition of the Sacrifice on the Cross for a distinct object 
and a distinct purpose.&nbsp; It was supplementary, and supplied 
a defect which the Sacrifice on the Cross failed to supply!</p>
<p><a name="footnote88"></a><a href="#citation88" 
class="footnote">[88]</a>&nbsp; What has been said on the subject
of &ldquo;The Sacrifices of Masses&rdquo; for souls in Purgatory 
must not be understood as implying that the Sacrifice in the Holy
Communion has no efficacy, when pleaded in behalf of the souls in
the Intermediate State.&nbsp; To use the words of Bishop Forbes, 
&ldquo;The application of the Blessed Eucharist to the departed 
must in our Church stand and fall with the practice of prayers 
for the dead.&nbsp; In its aspect of the great oblation, the Holy
Communion may be considered as prayer in its most intense and 
highest form.&nbsp; If it is unlawful to pray for the faithful 
departed, it must be unlawful to remember them in the sacred 
mysteries; but, if the first be permitted, the second must be so 
likewise.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Article XXXI., p. 63.)&nbsp; The subject 
of Prayers for the Dead is dealt with in the next Address, page 
101 <i>sq.</i></p>

<p><a name="footnote96"></a><a href="#citation96" 
class="footnote">[96]</a>&nbsp; A friend has suggested that Moses
and the prophets may, one after the other, have reported to 
Abraham the occurrences on earth in which they had severally 
themselves taken part, and that, therefore, we have in this 
narrative no more than an illustration of the mutual intercourse 
which exists in the Intermediate Life.&nbsp; To this it may be 
replied that this suggestion, so far from discrediting, really 
confirms the argument in the sermon.&nbsp; The suggestion is an 
attempt to explain the mode by which knowledge of what passes 
here is attained, which is certainly no disproof of the existence
of such knowledge.&nbsp; But it is safer to say that, some how or
other, the denizens of the Intermediate State do probably know, 
as Abraham certainly knew, occurrences on earth.</p>
<p><a name="footnote98"></a><a href="#citation98" 
class="footnote">[98]</a>&nbsp; Both these illustrations are, I 
find, referred to by Canon McColl in his &ldquo;Life Here and 
Hereafter,&rdquo; pp. 105, 106.&nbsp; But may I presume to 
question the value of his illustration of our Lord&rsquo;s 
knowledge of what was said, in His absence, on the way to Emmaus,
and by S. Thomas?&nbsp; Our Lord&rsquo;s knowledge after His 
Resurrection, and indeed at any time, is scarcely on a level with
the knowledge possessed by souls in the Intermediate State of 
what passes on earth.</p>
<p><a name="footnote99"></a><a href="#citation99" 
class="footnote">[99]</a>&nbsp; There is so much doubt as to the 
bearing upon this point of the words in Hebrews xii. 1, that I 
have not referred to it.&nbsp; Yet I would suggest that the 
comparison of our life on earth to the endeavours of the runners 
in the games of the amphitheatre implies that those efforts are 
made under the gaze of a cloud of spectators.&nbsp; The existence
of the spectators, and their interest in the contests, are 
integral facts in the similitude, and essential elements in 
it.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
